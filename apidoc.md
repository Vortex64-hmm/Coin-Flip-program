COIN FLIP API DOCUMENTATION: \
The api can take only one value, that being the amount of times to flip the coin. \
This is achieved by first loading the api from another file by first using "from api import api".\
It is recommended to place this at the top of your file, so it is loaded at program startup.\
Once the api is imported (any use of the api has to come AFTER the import, use "head, tail api()" to call the function.\
Place either a fixed integer, or variable integer into the brackets.
\
The variable "head" is the amount of times the coin lands on heads, and the variable "tail" is the amount of times the coin lands on tails.\

Hopefully this document helps explain the api, feel free to use it for, well anything I guess.
