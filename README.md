# Coin-Flip-program
a challenge I set myself to make a simple coinflip program, using external file references in python

> **_TO USE:_**

first run "first_time.bat". This will install numpy. Numpy is required to run the program, but if you prefer to install it yourself, use the command "pip install numpy" in the windows terminal.
Then run "main.py". The program should now be loaded, and running!

> **_API DOCUMENTATION_**

feel free to use the api I made for any of your projects, the documentation can be found in apidoc.md. If you don't understand anything about how it works (it is very simple, so you should be fine), feel free to ask in the issues section and I'll try get back quick.
